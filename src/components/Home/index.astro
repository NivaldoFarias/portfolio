		This portfolio website <strong>dynamically</strong> renders projects in the <code>repos/</code> subroute.
		<br />
		The homepage is <strong>statically delivered</strong> and each subroute's page is rendered
		<strong>server-side</strong>, delivering an <strong>almost-instant</strong>
		page load. The website is optimized for
		<strong>SEO</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong> and can be easily customized by changing
		the <strong class="fancy-text">theme</strong>
		using the widget on the upper-right corner.
